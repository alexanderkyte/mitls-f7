                                After the client sends its ClientKeyExchange message we compute the ougoing (and incoming) ccs_data,
                                and put it into our output buffer. Now, if the client hangs after the ClientKeyExchange (that is: it does
                                not send its CCS soon enough), the Dispatch module will stop reading and we will flush our output buffers,
                                thus clearing the outgoing KeyInfo. A subsequent read/write operation will trigger this code, which will
                                miserably fail.
                                Still, in the current implementation we must remove the ccs_data from the output buffer, in order to
                                send it only once. A better implementation keeps explicit track of the output message to be sent, and
                                do not rely on the content of the buffers, so we can store the outgoing ccs_data indefintely
                                (i.e. until we reset our state) exactly like we do for the incoming ccs_data *)
