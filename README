This is miTLS, a verified reference implementation of the TLS security protocol.

To compile, usually running "make" from the top level directory is enough. (See below for prerequisites.)
The compiled executables will be placed in the bin directory.
Each command line tool accepts a "--help" option to show
all the available command line options and their default values.

The following make targets can be used:
- build (default): compiles source code and puts executables in then bin directory
- dist: prepares a compressed archive that can be distributed
- dist-check: as dist, but also performs some sanity checks
- clean: remove object files
- dist-clean: remove object files and distribution archives

In the following, the prerequisites for each supported platform are given.

*** Microsoft Windows ***

- Cygwin, with the make utility installed
- .NET version 4 or above
- Visual F# 2.0
- Power Pack for F# 2.0

*** Linux and Mac OS X ***

- Mono framework, version 3.0.1 or above
- F# open source edition, version 3.0 or above
