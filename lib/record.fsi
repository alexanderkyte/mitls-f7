(* ProtocolVersion: 
  - the interface can be used only for setting and checking them (they are never passed up)
  - initially, sendState is the minimal and recvState is Unknown. 
  - for receiving only, the "Unknown" ProtocolVersion means that we do not know yet, 
    so we are accepting any reasonable one in each record.
    Conservatively, we change from Unknown to the first received version. *)

(* for now, we do not provide an interface for reporting sequence number overflows *)
