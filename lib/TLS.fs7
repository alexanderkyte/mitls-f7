(* For each call through this API, say connect(x,p) returning r,
   we may use homonymous events, say Connect(x,p) & Connected(x,p,r), 
   or something more ad hoc, like Writing, generated internally between Write & Written
   (s/Write/Writing/ later) 

   Missing: 

   predicate val Nego(cp,sp,ki) 
   // ki (or some other part of ci?) is an outcome of negotiating 
   // with initial parameters cp and sp; we will write its logical def.
   // it would be great if ki was unique, and non-existent if cp, sp are not compatible. 

   We miss some "Finished" event, 
   generated by the Handshake for each party, as it sends the CCS, carried by the Finished message
   To generate this event, we have a precise precondition that depends on the ciphersuite etc
   (from Handshake), to support fast start
   
   The other end logically receives that event after verifying the other guy's Finished message
   We reveal that event in the TLS interface, as a consequence of read returning Handshake.
   We may reveal that event early, using another ioresult_i, e.g. to enable "fast start".

   Example: as the client receives notification of a complete handshake, we have a thm:
   
   !c,c'. Read(c,Handshake(c')) => 
          ?sp.   Nego(cp(c),sp,ki(c'))
		      /\ Next(c,c') /\ Epoch(c') = Epoch(c)+1  
		      /\ ?c''. (Authorized(c'',serverCerts(c')) /\ Prior(c'',c))
			  /\ ( StrongHandshakeCipherSuite(ki(c')) /\ Honest(serverCerts(ki(c'))) 
			       => ServerFinished(sp,ki(*?*))

   Problem: intuitively, events tracking calls & returns are threaded by their connections,
   but logically that information is missing. To this end, we may explicitly thread connections,
   using 
   
   Next(c,c') <=> UID(c') = UID(c) /\ Seqn(c') = Seqn(c) + 1
   Prior(c,c') <=> UID(c') = UID(c) /\ Epoch(c') = Epoch(c) /\ Seqn(c) < Seqn(c')
